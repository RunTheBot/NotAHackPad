First pcb lol. I can't believe I made it this far without a single PCB. FRC, Infill ect.

Anyways, it's just a hackpad with a full pico and 100 buttons.

with 100 neopixels it gets complicated so barrel jack for power bc im not evan yu and i dont want to deal with USB PD.

I added a auto Polarity-correcting circuit so any barrel jack will work.

PCB layout done. Pretty basic. External PSU for LEDs and a RPI Pico.

I had to redo the schematic a lot of times because of kicad being weird. I crashed out.

Lots of modifactions to the PCB. Because of sizing issues.

BOM and redoing the PCB yet again. Getting JLC to work. I used the wrong footprint for the diodes ðŸ˜­.
